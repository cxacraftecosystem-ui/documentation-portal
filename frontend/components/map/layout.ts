/**
 * Turning points into pins that can actually be told apart.
 *
 * THE PROBLEM. One workshop with sixteen artisans is sixteen records on one coordinate, and a pile
 * of identical circles reads as a single record — the map understates itself by an order of
 * magnitude and gives no hint that it is doing so. There are two different collisions here and they
 * need two different answers:
 *
 *   IDENTICAL coordinates are folded on the SERVER, into one pin that carries `total`, `fixes` and
 *   `spreadMetres`. Sixteen artisans at the venue become one pin labelled sixteen. That is the only
 *   honest reduction: they really are one place.
 *
 *   NEARBY BUT DISTINCT places are handled HERE, by displacement rather than by folding. Bagru and
 *   Sanganer are 25 km apart — eight pixels at the scale a whole country is drawn at — but they are
 *   two towns with two different craft traditions, and merging them would erase a real distinction.
 *   So the smaller pin is pushed clear of the larger one and a hairline leader ties it back to its
 *   true coordinate, which is the standard cartographic answer and the only one that neither hides
 *   a place nor lies about where it is.
 *
 * The pass is deterministic — same points in, same pins out — so nothing moves between renders, and
 * it runs once per data change rather than per frame.
